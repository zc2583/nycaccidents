That means car crashes led to 1.11 deaths per 100 million miles traveled. Car crashes can be effectively prevented if we avoid to drive when dangerous factors exist. And that is the one of the reason that we can interested in researches of car crashes data. To detetct what factors contributed most to car crashes, we looked into 3 data sets from NYS DMV and tried to explain the correlation between those variables by using different visualization methods. Several questions that we are interested in are listed as below. Descriptive analysis of variables. Select some intuitive factors which lead to vehicle crashes and see if there is any association. As for the variable contributing factor, is there any noticeable cluster or trend? Using more variables to explore on a larger dataset, detect if there is any variable that largely contributed to crashes but neglected in question 1. Try to use as many as possible methods such as to find associations between variables. From all the plots we got, whats the new information we got? Good suggestions to avoid car crashes? Also, diving into event type, we can check if there are some particular associations between action prior to accident and event type or between contributing factor and event types and so on to see which could be the most probable cause of an event? We hope this article will help readers know more about how to avoid car accidents and have a safe drive!

Data are from US government public data. The three sets contain different attributes about each vehicle accident reported to NYS DMV. There are three aspects: vehicle, individual information and case information. Case ID is the common key attribute across three sets. Variables include Case Vehicle ID, Vehicle Body Type, Action Prior to Accident, Direction of Travel, Vehicle Year, State of Registration, Number of Occupants, Vehicle Make, Contributing Factor, Event Type, Driver Age, Weather Condition, Lighting Condition, Date, Week and so on 2.0.3 Potential Questions We got our data from the Internet which came as .csv files. The data we used are from NYS DMV which contains 3 data sets. Those three sets contain attributes about each vehicle involved in a crash as reported to NYS DMV. Variables include Case Vehicle ID, Vehicle Body Type , Action Prior to Accident, Direction of Travel, Vehicle Year, State of Registration, Number of Occupants, Vehicle Make, Contributing Factor, Event Type Most of which are categorical. To be more specific, our interest falls on several aspects: About Accident Cases: 1. Distribution of the number of accidents across time (Date, time, weekdays)? 2. Any environmental factors (weather condition, road surface, lighting condition) related to accidents? About Drivers: 1. Association between Injured severity and safety equipment? 2. Association between Injured severity and seating position? About Vehicle: 1. Relationship between number of accidents and Vehicle year? 2. Relationship between number of accidents and number of occupants? 3. Relationship between number of accidents and number of vehicle cylinder? The original data contains more than 800,000 samples each. For the convenience of later use, we did some random sampling. Before diving into the visualization work, we found some potential problems around the our data. Firstly, there are some misssing values in the data. Secondly, we need to select some variales that contribute the most to car crashes. Lastly, since most of our variables are categorical, we need to find better methods for visualization. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 General Method 3.2 Unify Missing Values", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 General Method From the government website, we downloaded three csv files. When we inspect the data ,we found that except for some missing values, the data provide clean and straightforward information. The numerical inputs are in reasonable domain, and textual inputs are understandable. However, every dataset has over one million of rows, which is difficult for us to take the whole data in exploratory data analysis. Thus, we decided to randomly sample 10000 rows per dataset to save time. 3.2 Unify Missing Values Except for NA, some inputs are labeled as Unknown,Not Applicable,UNKNOWN VEHICLE,Not Entered,None and so on. Thus, we also change all of these labels which provide no information as NA.

There is an obvious up-and down trend across months. The number of accidents is higher in the beginning, middle and the end of the year. Though the static plot can show this trend, here we want to visualize this trend in a more compelling and animated way. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "]]
