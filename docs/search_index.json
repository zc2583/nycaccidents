That means car crashes led to 1.11 deaths per 100 million miles traveled. Car crashes can be effectively prevented if we avoid to drive when dangerous factors exist. And that is the one of the reason that we can interested in researches of car crashes data. To detetct what factors contributed most to car crashes, we looked into 3 data sets from NYS DMV and tried to explain the correlation between those variables by using different visualization methods. Several questions that we are interested in are listed as below. Descriptive analysis of variables. Select some intuitive factors which lead to vehicle crashes and see if there is any association. As for the variable contributing factor, is there any noticeable cluster or trend? Using more variables to explore on a larger dataset, detect if there is any variable that largely contributed to crashes but neglected in question 1. Try to use as many as possible methods such as to find associations between variables. From all the plots we got, whats the new information we got? Good suggestions to avoid car crashes? Also, diving into event type, we can check if there are some particular associations between action prior to accident and event type or between contributing factor and event types and so on to see which could be the most probable cause of an event? We hope this article will help readers know more about how to avoid car accidents and have a safe drive!

Data are from US government public data. The three sets contain different attributes about each vehicle accident reported to NYS DMV. There are three aspects: vehicle, individual information and case information. Case ID is the common key attribute across three sets. Variables include Case Vehicle ID, Vehicle Body Type, Action Prior to Accident, Direction of Travel, Vehicle Year, State of Registration, Number of Occupants, Vehicle Make, Contributing Factor, Event Type, Driver Age, Weather Condition, Lighting Condition, Date, Week and so on 2.0.3 Potential Questions We got our data from the Internet which came as .csv files. The data we used are from NYS DMV which contains 3 data sets. Those three sets contain attributes about each vehicle involved in a crash as reported to NYS DMV. Variables include Case Vehicle ID, Vehicle Body Type , Action Prior to Accident, Direction of Travel, Vehicle Year, State of Registration, Number of Occupants, Vehicle Make, Contributing Factor, Event Type Most of which are categorical. To be more specific, our interest falls on several aspects: About Accident Cases: 1. Distribution of the number of accidents across time (Date, time, weekdays)? 2. Any environmental factors (weather condition, road surface, lighting condition) related to accidents? About Drivers: 1. Association between Injured severity and safety equipment? 2. Association between Injured severity and seating position? About Vehicle: 1. Relationship between number of accidents and Vehicle year? 2. Relationship between number of accidents and number of occupants? 3. Relationship between number of accidents and number of vehicle cylinder? The original data contains more than 800,000 samples each. For the convenience of later use, we did some random sampling. Before diving into the visualization work, we found some potential problems around the our data. Firstly, there are some misssing values in the data. Secondly, we need to select some variales that contribute the most to car crashes. Lastly, since most of our variables are categorical, we need to find better methods for visualization. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 General Method 3.2 Unify Missing Values", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 General Method From the government website, we downloaded three csv files. When we inspect the data ,we found that except for some missing values, the data provide clean and straightforward information. The numerical inputs are in reasonable domain, and textual inputs are understandable. However, every dataset has over one million of rows, which is difficult for us to take the whole data in exploratory data analysis. Thus, we decided to randomly sample 10000 rows per dataset to save time. 3.2 Unify Missing Values Except for NA, some inputs are labeled as Unknown,Not Applicable,UNKNOWN VEHICLE,Not Entered,None and so on. Thus, we also changed all of these labels which provide no information as NA. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Vehicle 4.2 Case 4.3 Individual", " Chapter 4 Missing values Since we have three datasets and they do not have a common key attribute for us to merge them together, we decided to visualize the missing values in three seperate graphs. 4.1 Vehicle 4.2 Case In this dataset, We had 18 variables in total and we dropped 2 of them. The majority of \\(DOT.Reference.Marker.Location\\) are missing values and the \\(Pedestrian.Bicyclist.Action\\) contains a lot of Not Applicable values which cannot offer the information we wnat. After transformation and cleaning of the dataset, we got the final data for visualiation use. 4.3 Individual In this dataset, we have 15 variables in total. Transported_by, Injury Location, Victim Status and Injury Description have high percent of missing data within the variable. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Vehicles 5.2 Case 5.3 Individual", " Chapter 5 Results In this part, we will show our EDA results in three categories related to vehicles involved in accidents, cases information and individuals in accidents. 5.1 Vehicles From this plot, we can see: Most of the accidents happen when cars go straight Ahead. Many accidents also happen during parking, stopping in traffic, slowing and stopping and making left or right turn. The patterns of all these prior actions are similar between 2018 and 2019. One interesting thing is that in 2018, there is no accidents related to Police Pursuit, but in 2019, there is a few cases. Thus, it looks like in the situations when drivers are going fast ahead or driving in a crowded place, such as in traffic or in parking lot, accidents are more likely to happen than the other prior actions. Since there are about 30 unique types of descriptions on accidents, I select the top 11 most frequent and reasonable textual descriptions on the causes of accidents. From this plot, we can see that: Driver Inattention is the top reason causing accidents. Following too closely, Failure to yield Right-of-Way and Unsafe Speed also cause many accidents. In 2019, there are further more accidents about Passing or lane Usage Improper and Backing Unsafely. In 2019, there are much more accidents due to Animals Action. In 2019, there are less accidents due to Alcohol Involvement. Probably New York States took this issue seriously in 2019. Thus, the top four categories seem to be the frequent causes for accidents. The pattern fro 2018 is different from 2019 in the other smaller causes. This is a mosaic plot with 3 variable: Vehicle_Body_Type, Contributing_Factor and Year. Since there are multiple unique Vehicle Body Types, we filter on the top 5 types involved in accidents. We also filter on contributing_Factor: E stands for environmental factor and V stands for vehicle factor. From this plot, we can see: There are more accidents of 4 Door Sedan and Suburban than the other vehicle types. Probably majority of vehicle is of these two types. There are more accidents related to environmental/vehicle factor in 2019 than in 2018. Larger proportion of accidents of 4 Door Sedan and 2 Door Sedan is related to environmental factor in 2019 than in 2018. From this plot, we can see: For 4 Engine Cylinder vehicles, Sedan and Suburban are more likely to have accidents. For 8 Engine Cylinder vehicles, Pickup Truck and Van Truck are more likely to have accidents. There are a few cars with 5 Engine Cylinder involved in accidents. 5.2 Case For the case data, we looked into the count of different types of accidents at first. We can see apparently from the bar plot that: Property Damage Accident occurred the most. Property Damage with Injury Accident. Fatal Accident happened the least. Then we used a cleveland plot to see where accidents happened the counties in New York State with the top 8 accident frequency: Crash accidents happened the most in Queens County. A very large amount of accidents happen in Queens, Nassau, Suffolk and Kings. There are other counties other than these 8 counties, but each of them has a relatively much smaller proportion of accidents when compared with the first 4 counties above. In this plot, we visualize the variation of number of accidents in Hours of a day. The line plots are split by years. Two years have the same trend. From 12PM-3PM, number of accidents decreases. Its going late, so there are fewer cars on the road and thus fewer accidents. From 4PM-8PM, number of accidents increases because people in various occupations are start going to work. From 9PM-10PM, the number of accidents drops a little bit. We are not sure why. probably many people has already arrived to their work places, so there are relatively fewer cars on the road. From 11PM-17PM, the number of accidents keeps increasing and finally reaches the peak of the day at 17PM. In this period, the city is in the busiest mode. Especially at around 17PM, people finish their jobs and travel to other places. Since 18PM, the number of accidents keeps dropping as the sun goes down. In this plot, we use a heatmap to show the frequency of accidents in specific Road Type and Road Surface Condition. In Road Type, straight and level has much more intensive weight than the other types because majority of road is this type. Thus, for visualization purpose, we exclude this type and focus on the other less common types: Even if we exclude the straight and level road type, straight and Grade has the top frequency. This is aligned with the finding in the first section that most of accidents happen when the cars go straight ahead. Probably some drivers tend to drive faster in straight road. Whatever the road surface is dry, wet or with snow, the Straight and Grade road still have the largest frequency. When the road is on Hill Crest, there are only a few accidents. Of course there are much less these road types. However, on hill crest, drivers are also drive more carefully than usual. 5.3 Individual From this plot, we can see that: In each age group, more males are involved in accidents than females. The number of accidents is low before 18 years old. These people are mostly the passengers. After 18 years old, the number of accidents increases dramatically and reaches the peak in age of 25. Probably young people are tend to drive less safely. Then, the number of accidents is constantly decreasing. Since majority of people in the accident are uninjured or only minor injured, we decided to explore the patterns in serious injuries. More males are injured to death than females. Females are easire to be shocked. More males are recorded as unconscious or semiconscious. It is possible that males tend to involve in more serious accidents. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Up-and-Down Trend of Monthly Number of Accidents in New York State", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Up-and-Down Trend of Monthly Number of Accidents in New York State This D3 animated plot is inspired by the bar chart of the monthly accidents. There is an obvious up-and down trend across months. The number of accidents is higher in the beginning, middle and the end of the year. Though the static plot can show this trend, here we want to visualize this trend in a more compelling and animated way. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "]]
