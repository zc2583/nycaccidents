That means car crashes led to 1.11 deaths per 100 million miles traveled. If we can find the patterns of factors which are likely to cause accident, many car accidents might somehow be prevented. This is why we are interested in exploring the car accidents data. In this project, we focused on the car accidents in New York State. Main Goal and Questions To detect what factors contributed most to car crashes, we looked into 3 datasets collected from 2018-2019 by NYS DMV. We aim at exploring the patterns in variables related to car accidents in New York State. Several questions that we are interested in are listed as below. In aspect of vehicle, what driving activity tends to cause more accidents? What types of vehicles are more likely to involve in accidents? What factors in road type or vehicle should be noticed? In aspect of accident cases, which regions in NYS have more accidents? What type of accidents are most common? Is hours of a day or months of a year related to number of accident? In aspect of drivers, does age has an effect? Does sex have an effect? Does safety equipment in vehicles have effect? Whats the patterns of injury for accidents in NYS? Generally, we are interested in exploring many aspects of NYS car accidents and identifying relationship between variables. Hopefully, our findings can be useful to prevent car accidents. We hope this article will help readers know more about how to avoid car accidents and have a safe drive!

Thus, the categorical inputs are all understandable and numerical inputs are mostly in reasonable domain. However, some variable have large amount of missing values, which cause some troubles in the later section, but the difficulty is manageable. Also, the three datasets cannot be merged together because they do not have a common key, but fortunately, each dataset have good amount of variables to explore. 2.4 Potential Questions To be more specific, our interest falls on several aspects: About Accident Cases: 1. Distribution of the number of accidents across time (Date, time, weekdays)? 2. Any environmental factors (weather condition, road surface, lighting condition) related to accidents? About Drivers: 1. Association between Injured severity and safety equipment? 2. Association between Injured severity and seating position? About Vehicle: 1. Relationship between number of accidents and Vehicle year? 2. Relationship between number of accidents and number of occupants? 3. Relationship between number of accidents and number of vehicle cylinder? The original data contains more than 800,000 samples each. For the convenience of later use, we did some random sampling. Before diving into the visualization work, we found some potential problems around the our data. Firstly, there are some misssing values in the data. Secondly, we need to select some variales that contribute the most to car crashes. Lastly, since most of our variables are categorical, we need to find better methods for visualization. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 General Method 3.2 Unify Missing Values", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 General Method From the government website, we downloaded three csv files. When we inspect the data ,we found that except for some missing values, the data provide clean and straightforward information. The numerical inputs are in reasonable domain, and textual inputs are understandable. However, every dataset has about or over one million of rows, which is difficult for us to take the whole data in exploratory data analysis. Thus, we decided to randomly sample 10000 rows per dataset to save time. 3.2 Unify Missing Values Except for NA, some inputs are labeled as Unknown,Not Applicable,UNKNOWN VEHICLE,Not Entered,None and so on. Thus, we also changed all of these labels which provide no information as NA. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Vehicle 4.2 Case 4.3 Individual", " Chapter 4 Missing values Since we have three datasets and they do not have a common key attribute for us to merge them together, we decided to visualize the missing values in three seperate graphs. 4.1 Vehicle In this dataset, Type/Axles of Truck or Bus has all missing values in the column. Event Type and Contributing Factor 1&amp;2 Descriptions also have many missing values. The other variables contain far less missing values. 4.2 Case In this dataset, We had 18 variables in total and we dropped 2 of them. The majority of DOT.Reference.Marker.Location are missing values and the Pedestrian.Bicyclist.Action contains a lot of Not Applicable values which cannot offer the information we want. After transformation and cleaning of the dataset, we got the final data for visualization use. 4.3 Individual In this dataset, we have 15 variables in total. Transported_by, Injury Location, Victim Status and Injury Description have high percent of missing data within the variable. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Vehicles 5.2 Case 5.3 Individual", " Chapter 5 Results In this part, we will show our EDA results in three categories related to vehicles involved in accidents, cases information and individuals in accidents. 5.1 Vehicles From this plot, we can see: Most of the accidents happen when cars go straight Ahead. Many accidents also happen during parking, stopping in traffic, slowing and stopping and making left or right turn. The patterns of all these prior actions are similar between 2018 and 2019. One interesting thing is that in 2018, there is no accidents related to Police Pursuit, but in 2019, there is a few cases. Thus, it looks like in the situations when drivers are going fast ahead or driving in a crowded place, such as in traffic or in parking lot, accidents are more likely to happen than the other prior actions. Since there are about 30 unique types of descriptions on accidents, I select the top 11 most frequent and reasonable textual descriptions on the causes of accidents. From this plot, we can see that: Driver Inattention is the top reason causing accidents. Following too closely, Failure to yield Right-of-Way and Unsafe Speed also cause many accidents. In 2019, there are further more accidents about Passing or lane Usage Improper and Backing Unsafely. In 2019, there are much more accidents due to Animals Action. In 2019, there are less accidents due to Alcohol Involvement. Probably New York States took this issue seriously in 2019. Thus, the top four categories seem to be the frequent causes for accidents. The pattern fro 2018 is different from 2019 in the other smaller causes. This is a mosaic plot with 3 variable: Vehicle_Body_Type, Contributing_Factor and Year. Since there are multiple unique Vehicle Body Types, we filter on the top 5 types involved in accidents. We also filter on contributing_Factor: E stands for environmental factor and V stands for vehicle factor. From this plot, we can see: There are more accidents of 4 Door Sedan and Suburban than the other vehicle types. Probably majority of vehicle is of these two types. There are more accidents related to environmental/vehicle factor in 2019 than in 2018. Larger proportion of accidents of 4 Door Sedan and 2 Door Sedan is related to environmental factor in 2019 than in 2018. From this plot, we can see: For 4 Engine Cylinder vehicles, Sedan and Suburban are more likely to have accidents. For 8 Engine Cylinder vehicles, Pickup Truck and Van Truck are more likely to have accidents. There are a few cars with 5 Engine Cylinder involved in accidents. 5.2 Case For the case data, we looked into the count of different types of accidents at first. We can see apparently from the bar plot that: Property Damage Accident occurred the most. Property Damage with Injury Accident. Fatal Accident happened the least. Then we used a cleveland plot to see where accidents happened the counties in New York State with the top 8 accident frequency: Crash accidents happened the most in Queens County. A very large amount of accidents happen in Queens, Nassau, Suffolk and Kings. There are other counties other than these 8 counties, but each of them has a relatively much smaller proportion of accidents when compared with the first 4 counties above. In this plot, we visualize the variation of number of accidents in Hours of a day. The line plots are split by years. Two years have the same trend. From 12PM-3PM, number of accidents decreases. Its going late, so there are fewer cars on the road and thus fewer accidents. From 4PM-8PM, number of accidents increases because people in various occupations are start going to work. From 9PM-10PM, the number of accidents drops a little bit. We are not sure why. probably many people has already arrived to their work places, so there are relatively fewer cars on the road. From 11PM-17PM, the number of accidents keeps increasing and finally reaches the peak of the day at 17PM. In this period, the city is in the busiest mode. Especially at around 17PM, people finish their jobs and travel to other places. Since 18PM, the number of accidents keeps dropping as the sun goes down. In this plot, we use a heatmap to show the frequency of accidents in specific Road Type and Road Surface Condition. In Road Type, straight and level has much more intensive weight than the other types because majority of road is this type. Thus, for visualization purpose, we exclude this type and focus on the other less common types: Even if we exclude the straight and level road type, straight and Grade has the top frequency. This is aligned with the finding in the first section that most of accidents happen when the cars go straight ahead. Probably some drivers tend to drive faster in straight road. Whatever the road surface is dry, wet or with snow, the Straight and Grade road still have the largest frequency. When the road is on Hill Crest, there are only a few accidents. Of course there are much less these road types. However, on hill crest, drivers are also drive more carefully than usual. 5.3 Individual From this plot, we can see that: In each age group, more males are involved in accidents than females. The number of accidents is low before 18 years old. These people are mostly the passengers. After 18 years old, the number of accidents increases dramatically and reaches the peak in age of 25. Probably young people are tend to drive less safely. Then, the number of accidents is constantly decreasing. Since majority of people in the accident are uninjured or only minor injured, we decided to explore the patterns in serious injuries. More males are injured to death than females. Females are easire to be shocked. More males are recorded as unconscious or semiconscious. It is possible that males tend to involve in more serious accidents. We use this alluvial plot show the flow between Sex, Safety Equipment Status and Injury Severity: More accidents happen when drivers have safety equipment deployed. When safety equipment is deployed, more males are injured than females. When safety equipment is deployed, drivers are less likely to be injured. When safety equipment is partly deployed, males are more likely to be uninjured. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Up-and-Down Trend of Monthly Number of Accidents in New York State", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Up-and-Down Trend of Monthly Number of Accidents in New York State This D3 animated plot is inspired by the bar chart of the monthly accidents in a year. There is an obvious up-and down trend across months. The number of accidents is higher in the beginning, middle and the end of the year. Though the static plot can show this trend, here we want to visualize this trend in a more compelling and animated way. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitation 7.2 Future Lessons and Directions", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitation 7.1.1 Imbalanced Inputs in Variables The datasets suffered imbalanced distribution in many variables as many variables contain different proportion of values and missing value. Thus, visualization results can potentially be biased: A variable can be 80% of input A but only 2% of input B. During visualization, we tried to unite inputs in small proportion in order to minimize the effect of unbalance. For example, in variable Road Type, straight Road is where accidents happened the most, while it might be attributed to the case that most roads are straight. 7.1.2 Missing Values The deletion of missing values may influence the overall patterns between variables: In many plots, we or the default setting excluded the missing values from a variable and the related rows of data. It is possible that this action can delete useful information in other variables. Missing values can potentially be the key to capture a pattern. When they are missed, the visualized pattern might be misleading. For example, when plotting relationships between sexes and victim status, many missing values are in victim status. Thus, the graph of sex and victim status may be incomplete to capture the patterns between two variables; There might be risks in concluding that sex is associated with victim status under car crashes. 7.1.3 Not All variables Were Used We have three datasets for three aspects of car accidents. In total, we have more than 40 variables. Thus, we are unable to explore relationship between every possible pairs of variables. Other unused variable can contain other useful patterns or information. 7.1.4 Data is Too Large to Plot Locally We have three datasets. Each of them contain millions of rows and more than 10 variables. Thus, it will take painfully long time to visualize the whole data in our local computer. Thus, we decided to sample the data to show the general trend. However, it is possible that we have a sample deviated from the general trends. 7.2 Future Lessons and Directions In this part, we discuss what we have learned during our project and potential directions to improve our results: For too large datasets, we can first select the variables we want to use for a single graph in order to shorten the runtime. Then we can explore overall patterns in the original datasets and compare it with our patterns in sample data. For missing values, we can try imputing missing values first or delete it if it only occupies a small percentage in the data before analysis in future research. For imbalancned data, we can unite the smaller groups of inputs to a larger group. Otherwise, we can focus on subsets of groups, where the proportion is more balanced. We can also sample the data according to the proportions of imbalanced inputs in a variable. To better use of all variables such as location, we can apply geographic plot to extract more information in the future. "]]
